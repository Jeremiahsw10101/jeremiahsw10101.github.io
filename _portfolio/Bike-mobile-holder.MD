## Introduction

Top-down modeling is a methodology used in modeling complex designs and products. 
It begins by creating a high-level design of the entire product, often referred to as the top-level assembly.
Progressively, additional details and components are gradually integrated to guarantee precise fitting of all elements 
Through this methodology, it is ensured that the product functions as intended.


## Bike mobile-holder top-down modeling

We began by creating an assembly file for the bike phone mount. We imported samples of both the bike handlebar and the mobile device into the Fusion 360 program. Using the handlebar's cross-section projection, we designed a clamp with the precise radius required. Following that, we designed the shaft and surface base to support the mobile device, ensuring seamless 360-degree rotation between the two parts. Lastly, we added an enclosure to securely hold the mobile device in place.


## Rationale behind the design
Functionality:The mobile holder rotates 360 degrees for both horizontal and vertical use. 
The handlebar clamp is divided into two parts, the bottom and top part, for ease of installation and a firm hold on the bar.

Manufacturability: The design consists of four parts, three of which can be printed without the need for support material. 
The entire design can be printed on desktop 3D printers without requiring a high-temperature heat bed or enclosure. 

Ergonomics and User Experience: No tools are needed to mount the mobile phone or rotate it.

Durability, Reliability, and Cost Considerations:It is made of thick PLA material, which is durable, rigid, and cost-effective.

                                                        

## Material choice 
The bike phone holder was printed using PLA filament. PLA allows the holder to be stiff and rigid. 
However, if the phone holder is going to be exposed to direct sunlight for an extended period, it needs to be coated with a UV-resistant coating. 


## Assembly instructions
