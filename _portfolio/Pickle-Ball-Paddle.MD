## Design 
3d printed parts of the pickle ball paddle were printed in a way so that it stays durable during the game and avoids getting delaminated. this was achieved by setting the orientation in a way that the laminates layers were printed in a perpendicular angle to the force instead of parallel to the force 
A groove profile has been made around the paddle’s edge for easy installation and removal of the interchangeable edge guard.

## Material:
The grip is made of two materials:
1-PLA for strength 
2-TPU mesh for a better grip and to add a comfort grip to the players.

the base part was made using PLA and the handle was made using TPU

## Weight 
The paddle’s weight lies between the light to medium weight to cover a greater number of playing styles, both agility and heavy weight 
## Balance
The weight was distributed equally on both the handle and the body so that the center of gravity of the paddle lays exactly at the center of the paddle (horizontally and vertically) . This provides the paddle a balance that makes it easier for the player to control the paddle
