## Design 
The 3D-printed parts of the pickleball paddle were printed in a manner that ensures durability during gameplay and prevents delamination. This was achieved by orienting the laminated layers perpendicular to the force rather than parallel to it.

A groove profile has been created around the paddle's edge to facilitate the easy installation and removal of the interchangeable edge guard.

## Material:
The grip is made of two materials:
1-PLA for strength 
2-TPU mesh is used to provide players with a better grip and enhanced comfort during gameplay.

## Weight 
The paddle's weight falls within the light to medium range, catering to a wide range of playing styles, including both agility-focused and power-oriented players.
## Balance
The weight is evenly distributed between the handle and the body, ensuring that the paddle's center of gravity is precisely located at its midpoint both horizontally and vertically. This balance enhances the paddle's control and makes it easier for the player to maneuver.
